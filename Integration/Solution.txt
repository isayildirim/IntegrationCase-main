Single Server Scenario
This solution prevents the same content from being recorded when more than one content is tried to be recorded at the same time.
It allows different contents to be processed simultaneously while preventing multiple recordings.
This approach was made to increase performance and prevent unnecessary waiting.

Changes made in the service layer;
ConcurrentDictionary Added: Allows simultaneous checking of contents.
Use of Lock Mechanism: During the content saving process, a lock mechanism has been added to prevent the same content from being saved more than once.
The GetAllItems method used in the Service layer has been made asynchronous.
